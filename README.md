## Why did we choose this problem?

In our daily lives, contact centers from e-commerce platforms encounter several critical challenges:
- **Long Wait Times**: These lead to customer dissatisfaction and potential churn.
- **Limited Service Hours**: Restricting customer interaction to specific times.
- **Impersonal Service**: This impacts customer loyalty and satisfaction.
- **High Operational Costs**: Managing and scaling operations can be expensive.
- **Inefficient Data Handling**: Poor data management can hinder performance and decision-making.
- **Time-Consuming Post-Contact Processing**: Lengthy processing after customer interactions slows down overall efficiency.


## How do we approach to provide a difference?
#### The Power of Gen AI
Implementing Gen AI could potentially save contact centers 30 to 45% of current operational costs, focusing solely on direct productivity gains without considering the potential boost in customer satisfaction from a more tailored experience.

Moreover, McKinsey has reported that Gen AI offers transformative benefits for contact centers in the following ways:
- **Enhanced Productivity**: Studies show a potential 14% increase in issue resolution per hour and a 9% reduction in handling time.
- **Improved Service Quality**: Less-experienced agents benefit the most, while overall productivity and quality rise.
- **Customer Self-Service**: Up to 50% of customer inquiries can be automated through AI-powered chatbots.
- **Speedier Responses**: Real-time AI assistance reduces response times for sales representatives.
- **Increased Sales and Coaching**: AI-driven insights aid in personalized sales strategies and agent coaching.

## What is the difference that we have created through our solution?
To enhance customer and agent experiences, we developed a solution leveraging AWS services like Connect, Bedrock, Kendra, S3, Lambda, and Lex. Here's a concise overview:

1. **Automated Customer Support**: The Lex chatbot handles initial customer inquiries, using Kendra to provide quick and accurate information from the knowledge base, ensuring immediate assistance and reducing agent workload.

2. **Enhanced Agent Support**: When escalated, AWS Connect routes calls to human agents, while Bedrock provides real-time AI-driven insights and suggestions. AWS Lambda automates routine tasks, and S3 manages data storage and retrieval, ensuring efficient operations.

Additionally, **AWS Wisdom Integration** enhances agent support by offering real-time document recommendations based on customer queries, optimizing agent productivity and improving customer experiences.
