#### Why did we choose this problem?
In our daily lives, contact centers from e-commerce platforms encounter several critical challenges:
- **Long Wait Times**: These lead to customer dissatisfaction and potential churn.
- **Limited Service Hours**: Restricting customer interaction to specific times.
- **Impersonal Service**: This impacts customer loyalty and satisfaction.
- **High Operational Costs**: Managing and scaling operations can be expensive.
- **Inefficient Data Handling**: Poor data management can hinder performance and decision-making.
- **Time-Consuming Post-Contact Processing**: Lengthy processing after customer interactions slows down overall efficiency.



#### How do we approach to provide a difference?
**Gen AI** can help us addresses these issues by reducing wait times, enabling 24/7 service, personalizing interactions, cutting operational costs, improving scalability, optimizing data analysis, and automating post-contact tasks.
